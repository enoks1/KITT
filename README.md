# KITT
An Autonomous Driving Challenge using KITT.

## Possible helpful notes on using Git
Before you start always make sure to update (or pull) from upstream (latest version of the project) using `git pull`.<br>
To save changes (or push) so that others can pull your code; first add all files using `git add .`,<br> subsequently add a commit by doing `git commit -m "Add some commit."` and <br> to finally push it to the repository do `git push`.<br><br>
<i>When downloading this repository for the first time on your machine first do `git clone https://github.com/enoks1/KITT.git`, afterwards pulling suffices.</i>
